<h1>Weather-App Project</h1>

<h2>Things that I learned:</h2>

- The idea of this project was to learn how to take a api key from a API website, use that key within your code, and display the results to your page
- I learned how to get an api key and set it to a variable to be used within an async/await function
- I learned a bit more on what async/await functions are, promises, and api data usage
- I had created input fields before and noticed that I only knew how to use the fields with a button attached; I learned how to use keypress in order to submit the input with by pressing Enter
- Got to practice more on taking data received through the api and applying that data to variables in JS to affect the DOM
